# Gender_Gap_In_College_Degrees

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website.

Randal compiled this data set to explore the gender gap in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This gap is reported on often in the news and not everyone agrees that there is a gap.

Previously, for practice, I mainly focused on the STEM degrees but now I will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. Toward the end of the investigation I will export my final diagram as an image file.
